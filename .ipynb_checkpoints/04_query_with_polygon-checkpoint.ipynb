    "## Generate depth to surface area tables by merging satellite data with depth gauge data\n",
    "This notebook merges gauge data with satellite data for multiple reservoirs at a time (in the 00_Library directory). It outputs a depth to surface area table for the reservoirs. The inputs are 1) a shapefile of reservoirs with their gauge ID attached and 2) the folder containing the csv files of gauge data. At the top of the screen is a tab called Kernel. If you want to start the notebook again at anytime and clear everything, you can select Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs. The available memory is at the bottom of the screen. You have 15GB of memory and if the memory is exceeded the kernel will crash (but it's ok you can just start it again). Read the instructions carefully to run the code blocks and understand what's going on at each step. Press Shift + Enter to run a code block. Good Luck! - Katey"

    "The inputs are the reservoir shapefile with the gauge IDs attached and the directory that contains the csv files of gauge data. We can also define how deep the reservoir should be before we start taking every 2m instead of every 1m. It's better for larger reservoirs to take every 2m because in my opinion it's more accurate to do this because it improves the image quality of each depth slice. I recommend 25 or 30 as the limit. Also put todays date in 'dd-mm-yyyy' format to get the latest satellite data. The image_cap variable is a little hard to explain, but basically this is how many images you are willing to load per depth interval. The more images you load, the more accurate the results will be but the longer it will take to run this script. If you just want to quickly see how this script works, set the image cap to 10 (approx. 20 minutes to calculate the surface areas of 150 reservoirs). If you want the most accurate results you don't want to limit the images at all so set the image cap to 10000 to effectively unlimit it (approx. 3 hours, could maybe crash).  "

    "'Dask load' which is the dask_chunks = { } argument in the dc.load line means you only load satellite data parameters, not the actual images, which is good for linking the satellite data to the gauge data without it taking literally hours. So basically, in this box we read the shapefile with the reservoir polygons and query the satellite data with the polygons. Most of the query is done in a loop because we have to make hundreds of queries, one for each reservoir. To handle all these queries, we put them in a dictionary and use the gauge ID as the key for each query, so we can call the satellite data later on by the gauge ID. This is great, because the csv files of the depth gauge data all have the gauge ID in them so it's going to be easy to match up the satellite data of each reservoir with the gauge data just by using the gauge ID as the handle.
