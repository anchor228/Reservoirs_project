You have to do one at a time, because each reservoir is different and you have to make a decision on each one about which images to use. You should have generated image profiles for each reservoir by now, so you can see the actual images from which the surface area is being calculated. This notebook is a little bit hard to use, so read the markdowns carefully.\n",

    "## Read csv and split into depth intervals\n",
    "This is where you enter the location of the csv file of the initial depth to surface area table you made. The bad_rows variable can be used if you want to skip the lowest depths, for example if the first image is empty, eg surface area = 0, you will want to skip that, so put bad_rows = [0]. There is an argument in the code that says 'if the surface area for x depth is lower than x-1 depth, delete this image', because surface area going down with increasing depth obviously doesn't make sense. So if the second image is also 0, you don't have to enter it as a bad_row, because it's going to be deleted anyway. If you have an image at say, depth 6 that is going to be counted because it is a larger surface area than depth 5, however you notice that the image quality is bad, you can enter it as a bad_row so it doesn't get counted, so you might enter bad_rows = [0, 6]. If you have 0 or bad images for higher depths, don't worry because they are getting skipped anyway so you don't have to enter them. If you don't have any images that need to manually be skipped, hash this line out. The bad_row variable is just extra making sure you don't use bad images to calculate surface area. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an argument in this code block that says 'if there are more than 25 depth intervals, only use every 2m instead of every 1m'. This will give you better quality images because each image will be made of more passes. For big reservoirs like Blowering which varies by 70 meters, I think it's more accurate to have good quality images for every second meter and interpolate every other depth rather than try to make 70 images with only a few passes in each. But make a decision your self, if you have a reservoir that varies by 30m but you think the images are really good, change the code so it won't take every 2m and keep using every 1m.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also some annoying things about this box that I haven't really bothered to try and fix. Some of the gauge IDs are pure numbers, some of them have letters, making them strings. The code has to read the ID as a string, so if the gauge ID is a number, you will have to convert it to a string. If it's already a string and you try to convert it to a string, it will throw an error. I just hash the 'ID_str = ID_str.astype(str)' line in and out as needed. The other thing is that sometimes 2 bounding boxes will be called, which will make you get an error later (there might be 2 boxes because the spatial join matched one gauge to 2 different very close reservoirs). At the bottom there is a line that is 'box = box_row.geometry'. If you have 2 bounding boxes you need choose one like this: box = box_row.geometry[0] or box = box_row.geometry[1] and make sure you get the right one.  "

    "## Extrapolate higher depths\n",
    "The Interpolate function won't get the highest or lowest depths, as it can only get the inbetween depths. To get the lowers and higher depths I have used a simple polynomial (y = mx + b) to calculate what the curve might look like at the extremities of the depths. This might not be super super accurate, but it's probably close enough, and there won't be many days when the gauge reads these levels anyway, so error will be minimised for our purposes. The code block after this one will show you the curve with the extrapolated values. You can alter this code if you think the curve doesn't look quite right (eg if there is negative surface areas in the lower extrapolations). An image of this graph will be saved in the images folder."

The 'Number of images after masking' column tells you how many images were stacked to calculate the final surface area. Anything with 10 or more images, I would consider quite accurate. If there's only 1 or 2 images, it could still be accurate depending on the pass, but you should check the image and make a decision. NaN values mean there were no images used in the calculation of that surface area, and the value was derived from either interpolation or extrapolation with the polynomial. "
