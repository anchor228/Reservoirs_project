These csv files have been downloaded from the Bureau of Meteorology Water Data Online at http://www.bom.gov.au/waterdata/ between March and May 2021. Some of the files have been edited to delete outliers and in-filled data so as to make the output of the depth to surface area tables more accurate. The filling up periods of the reservoirs has also been excluded if the filling up period was pre-satellite era (1988).
